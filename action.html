				The curent president of Brazil, Luís Inácio Lula da Silva, has overseen a drastic decrease in the rate of deforestation since taking office. Efforts are being undertaken to realize that the economic value provided in keeping the forest undeveloped outweighs the potential profit from resource extraction, but it remains to be seen how Brazilians will be convinced, or paid off, to see it that way.

			<p>
				As individuals, all we can do is vote, at the polls and with our wallets, to disincentivize activities that are destructive to the Amazon. Whether it be electing politicians that vow to do the least harm or decrease consumption of products originating from deforested land, such as beef and soy, there is a always a little something that can be done on our end.
