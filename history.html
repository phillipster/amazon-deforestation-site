				<h2>Early 20th Century</h2>

					<p>
						Before the 1960s, access to the interior of the Amazon Rainforest was very restricted. Brazil, which holds some 60% of the rainforest's total area, was an undeveloped agrarian nation. There was a rubber boom in the late 19th century, but this did not last long due to competition from European colonies in Asia and, later on, the development of synthetic rubber. The Amazon was pristine, relatively untouched by any human development.

					<h2>"A Marcha para o Oeste"</h2>

					<p>
						Getúlio Vargas, the dictator of Brazil from 1930 to 1945, envisioned a country that populate its interior in order to extract wealth and resources from the vast, untapped wilderness. Hundreds of thousands of people from the country's impoverished Northeast region were recruited to live in the Amazon, populating cities such as Manaus and Belém.

					<p>
						As the country began its second descent into dictatorship, a policy of great works took place in the Amazon. The construction of new highways, such as the BR-230 (Transamazônica), set into motion the pattern of systematic deforestation in the region.

					<h2>1970s and 80s</h2>
					<img src="desmatamento.webp" class="compress">
					<p>
						As the population of the Brazilian Amazon reaches 7 million, environmental concerns begin to arise. By 1978, the deforested area had already reached 14 million hectares. The unregulated buying, selling, and parcelling of lands in the Amazon resulted in disjointed nonsense, the violation and persecution of indigenous tribes, and the further destabilization of the region. Political leaders such as Chico Mendes who are against destruction of the rainforest are systematically targeted, and some cases murdered, by the dictatorship.

					<h2>1990s and 2000s</h2>
					<img src="soja.webp" class="compress">
					<p>
						Massive soy plantations take root in the Amazon, as agricultural products are one of the few competitive exports of the Brazilian economy. Rather than heeding the warnings of scientists around the world, private interest groups enrich themselves from the land. By the end of the 90s, a whopping 41 million hectares of forst had been cleared for human development. By 2003, cattle outnumbered humans nearly 3 to 1, marking a rapid shift in land use in the region.

						By 2009, 70 million hectares of forest had been destroyed in Brazil alone, representing 10~15% of its original size.
